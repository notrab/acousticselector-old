      We've carried out over 400 sound attenuating tests with a wide range of
      door types. Single leaf, single action, double leaf (pairs), double action
      configurations, glazed, unglazed, doors with letterboxes, the works! All
      tests were carried out to the <strong>BS EN IS0 140: 3: 1995</strong>{' '}
      requirements.
    </p>

    <p>
      In case you’re curious, here’s the fundamentals of a{' '}
      <strong>BS EN IS0 140-3</strong> test:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A specimen is placed between a sound transmitting room and a sound
        receiving room
      </li>
      <li>
        Sound is generated over a range of frequencies in the transmitting room
      </li>
      <li>
        The sound pressure levels (loudness) of the sound are measured in the
        receiving room after passing through the specimen
      </li>
      <li>
        The received sound pressure levels are deducted from the transmitted
        sound pressure levels to determine the sound pressure loss at each of
        the tested frequencies
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      For consistency, we carry out all our acoustic tests at Norseal using a
      2040 x 926mm sized door. This is the largest single leaf door size
      described by reference to BS 4787 Pt. 1.
    </p>

    <p>
      You'll notice that many of the seals in Acoustic Selector are our own
      brand - Norseal. It’s really important to us that any seals we put our
      name to, are not only a cost effective solution for you, but are also
      simple to use and don’t hinder the normal use of the door.
